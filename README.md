# Ivan’s Homebrew formulae

Personal [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) formulae repository. Modifications to
existing ones, formulae which for whatever reason won’t go to main repo or
formulae for my personal projects.

Want to **install** something from here?

```bash
brew tap niksy/pljoska
brew install FORMULA
```

## Formulae available

### [flegma](https://github.com/niksy/flegma)

Simple network bandwidth throttler.

### [entizeta](https://github.com/niksy/entizeta)

Simple entity converter.

### cheat

> '[cheat](https://github.com/jahendrie/cheat)' is a cheat-sheet script for people who are too impatient to browse
the manual page for a given program.  It's well-suited for those who might
use a program only occasionally, and need only brief reminders on the
'important bits'; the cliff-notes version of man pages, if you will.

> This particular version, written as a Bash script, is a reimplementation of
a Python script originally written by Chris Lane.  The other version is the
'main' version; this is the off-shoot.

### [setfileicon](http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/xcode/250445-custom-icon-for-bundle.html#250519)

> I've written a command line tool that modify the icon of a file or
folder (it was also for setting the icon of a bundle). If you didn't
have already found a solution, feel free to use it (source code is
available, just ask) :

Why "pljoska"? Croatian name for [hip flask](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_flask). I know, it’s stupid.
